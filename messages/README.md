##Messages lab

1. I think that the lab has been implemented correctly overall. When using data.json, everything works correctly and I think it has been implemented neatly.

2. Marcy Regalado helped me with getting started as I missed class last week for being sick. She helped me with conceptual ideas as well as some of the coding and explanation of functions. Jake Caccamo and I talked about why Part 2 did not work.

3. I spent about 2.5 to 3 hours on this lab.

4. Is it possible to request data from a different origin or from your local machine using XMLHttpRequest? -- No this is not possible because of the same origin policy. Same origin policy exists to be sure that data from one site can only be requested on that site in order to protect privacy. It would be very bad if different websites could take data from each other because on many sites (bank accounts, personal email) data is sensitive and private. Therefore, in this example, the program only works online rather than in the local file and you can only use a json file in the repository rather than any URI.
