##My Git repo for Comp20 Spring 2015

1. **What is the purpose of this Git repository?**
This is where all of my labs and assignments (except the serverside code for Marauder's Map) are stored.

2. **What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?**
I certainly had a lot of fun with Assignment 1, creating my personal webpage. I plan to go back to it and neaten it up and improve it over the summer. However my favorite assignment was probably the Captain's Log lab. I really had fun using jQuery and also practicing data persistence in local storage. I spent a lot of time getting each piece to work and really enjoyed the process.

3. **How much do you think you have grown from day one of the course to now?**
I certainly have learned a lot and expanded my programming knowledge. I think my most important developments include learning to be flexible and understand a range of different languages and platforms as well as understanding the concept of asynchronous programming.

4. **What was the most important thing that you learned in this course?**
To expand on becoming more flexible as a programmer, I learned the importance of looking for information in the right places. By the end of the course, I was much better at troubleshooting by effectively searching API documentation and stackoverflow rather than futile trial and error. A second most important thing I learned in this class is how to use revision control. At the beginning of the semester I was hopelessly lost trying to use Git and ran into some issues that I had no idea how to fix. Now I have a better understanding and can work my way through any issues that arise.

5. **Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?**
I would like to become more familiar with JavaScript and especially jQuery. I feel like if I spend more time using it, I will better grasp its capabilities and then be more comfortable using it.
