##My Git repo for Comp20 Spring 2015

1. What is the purpose of this Git repository?
	This is where all of my labs and assignments (except the serverside code for Marauder's Map) are stored.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
	I certainly had a lot of fun with Assignment 1, creating my personal webpage. I plan to go back to it and neaten it up and improve it over the summer. However my favorite assignment was probably the Captain's Log lab. I really had fun using jQuery and also practicing data persistence in local storage. I spent a lot of time getting each piece to work and really enjoyed the process.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day one of the course to now?
	I certainly have learned a lot and expanded my programming knowledge. I think my most important developments include learning to be flexible and understand a range of different languages and platforms as well as understanding the concept of asynchronous programming.

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course?
	To expand on becoming more flexible as a programmer, I learned the importance of looking for information in the right places. By the end of the course, I was much better at troubleshooting by effectively searching API documentation and stackoverflow rather than futile trial and error. A second most important thing I learned in this class is how to use revision control. At the beginning of the semester I was hopelessly lost trying to use Git and ran into some issues that I had no idea how to fix. Now I have a better understanding and can work my way through any issues that arise.

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
	I would like to become more familiar with JavaScript and especially jQuery. I feel like if I spend more time using it, I will better grasp its capabilities and then be more comfortable using it.
