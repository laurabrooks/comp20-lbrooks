###Lab 4
###Responsive Design

1. This lab is fairly simple and I think that I successfully implemented the given task. The image changes depending on the browser size although I had some trouble initially because I was missing the px unit label on the max-width attributes.

2. Jacob Caccamo helped me work through what my issue was when I didn't know why my code wasn't working.

3. It took me roughly 3 hours to complete the entire lab including looking through resources and troubleshooting.
