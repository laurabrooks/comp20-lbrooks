##Lab 5
###Ms. Pac Man

1. To my knowledge, the code is implemented about as neatly as possible. The only thing I am still a bit unsure about is when it is necessary to declare "var" and I think it was ok that I didn't do so before "canvas" and "ctx". The game board does appear on the webpage upon loading with Ms. Pac Man on it.

2. I worked on this project without discussing much of it at all. I did check with Jake Caccamo to make sure it made sense that my game board wasn't positioned to the left on the screen.

3. I spent roughly 2 hours completing this assignment.
