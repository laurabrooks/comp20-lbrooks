##Assignment 4: Security Report

1. I think that I completed the assignment thoroughly and addressed all aspects necessary.

2. Jake Caccamo and I discussed several options to pursue to find security vulnerabilities. Of course Jason Fan helped me out by giving me access to his code.

3. I spent about 10 hours on the assignment.
