##Marauder's Map!

1. The assignment is fully functional. Everything is implemented correctly but sometimes neater than others. My HTTP POST request is neat, but my InfoWindows for everyone's markers is implemented with some weird code. It took a lot of trial and error and could probably be done in a more straightforward way. Also I don't have the best grasp on scoping, so I think that my variables could be declared in a more uniform way.

2. Marcy Regalado helped talk me through a lot of the conceptual ideas for the HTTP POST request, helping me get started on the assignment. Nitesh Gupta helped me when I couldn't find some bugs and gave me good advice for how to use the JavaScript console to find bugs. Lucy Qin helped a lot when I couldn't get my markers and info windows quite right.

3. I spent roughly 15 hours on this assignment.
