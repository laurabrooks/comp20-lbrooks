###Captain's Log

1. In Google Chrome everything works. However, it seems that Chrome and Firefox store dates differently and therefore using my date conversion, Firefox gives the wrong date.

2. Jake Caccamo gave me some advice about the for loop for storing local storage.

3. I spent about 5 hours on this assignment.
